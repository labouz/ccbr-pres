## Speech Recognition

### What is it?

> Speech recognition focuses on the translation of speech from a verbal format to a text one whereas voice recognition just seeks to identify an individual userâ€™s voice^1^

> Sensor data in time series play a major role in many applications. They are
generalizations of static observations and often crucial for the diagnosis of faults and
diseases....Speech by its very nature falls into this category because it produces signal data and
happens in a temporal development^2^

- *Vocabulary* container = versatile

- *Similarity*  
  - Phonetic similarity   
    - contains subjective elements
  - Symbolic similarity  
    - on the word level - symbols generated from feature level
    - related to semantic issues

???
vocabulary container in this kind of system is versatile as there are degrees of freedom when formulating an expression - meaning there are different ways to formulate an expression, which is good for minimizing recognition errors -  for example the usage of synonyms

similarity: 
The phonetic measure contains subjective elements like pronunciations.
the symbolic measure is related to semantics - text is static while speech is nearly impossible to repeat

adaptation: two kinds
query: takes place regularly - step of cleaning data
solution: takes place on the symbolic and the overall levels. The goal
is to correct errors in the messages
queries are spoken commands and solutions are symbolic commands that have to be performed

cases:
The feature vectors can be compared with a similarity measure. They denote actually occurring queries or solutions
